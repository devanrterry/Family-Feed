# Family Feed



### Intro

Family Feed is a social networking app that helps families stay in touch. Other forms of communication such as social media or group texts can feel overwhelming or difficult to use for the less technologically-abled. Family Feed provides a simple sign up and login process, and maintains an ongoing feed of your family's posts. So you'll never lose touch, and can share all of life's important moments with those you love. 

### Technologies:

HTML, CSS, Javascript, React.js, MongoDB, Express, Node.js, Materialize CSS

## Unsolved Problems

The main unsolved problem was incorporating the user story of creating a private family group. There are also a few CSS features that I would like to successfully use. 

### Future Enhancements:

- Allow the user to create a private family group containing only approved users
- Incorporate direct messaging through socket.io 
- Allow video uploads
- Create an interactive timeline of posts
